- *Context API*: Global state management for authentication using React Context.  
- *Token Handling*: Secure storage and automatic inclusion of tokens in API requests.  
- *Protected Routes*: Conditional access control based on user authentication status.  

#### *3. API Client Structure*  
- *Axios Setup*: Centralized HTTP client with request/response interceptors.  
- *Service Layer*: Dedicated modules for API calls to maintain separation of concerns.  
- *Error Management*: Unified error handling with user-friendly feedback.  
- *Environment Variables*: Proper configuration for API endpoints.  

#### *4. State Management Techniques*  
- *React Context*: Global state for authentication.
